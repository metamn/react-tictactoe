## React Tic Tac Toe

The first step in learning React.

### How it works?

In `src/index.1.js` the React tutorial from https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html is implemented using the website.

After that in `src/index.js` the tutorial is re-created from scratch by trying to use best practices like *component structure*, *documentation*, *styled components* and so on.

### First impressions

- It seems everything (styleguidist, styled components) is working out of the box. One year ago with Vue I had problems with all these.
- I like the incorporated best practices like pure components, immutability (so far) and perhaps higher order functions later.
- I like the simplicity and effectiveness in the React philosophy like `donâ€™t spend more than five minutes on choosing a file structure`. Or https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
- There are some *glitches* too at first sight, like not being able to render a loop with `for`
- While Vue is focusing on nicer syntax (single file components) React is focusing on writing the best code possible even if / which is often more slow and complicated at first, but pays of on the long run.
- Both Vue and React docs are very well done, but React is a step further, probably the best I've ever seen. The language is just so professional.
